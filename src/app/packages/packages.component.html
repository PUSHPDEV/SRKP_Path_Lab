                    <p class="card-text">
                        Complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health
                        & wellness and detect a wide range of disorders like anemia, infection and leukemia. This test
                        measures several components and features of your blood like Red blood cells which carry oxygen;
                        White blood cells which fight infection; Hemoglobin the oxygen carrying protein in red blood
                        cells; Hematocrit proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component or plasma in your blood;
                        Platelets which help with blood clotting. Abnormal increases or decreases in cell counts as
                        revealed in a Complete blood count may indicate that you have an underlying medical condition
                        that calls for further evaluation. This test also helps to monitor a known medical condition.

                        HbA1c also called Glycated hemoglobin gives the average sugar level in the body over a period of
                        2 to 3 months unlike blood sugar which indicates daily level. This test is used to diagnose
                        prediabetes, diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabetes & monitor your diabetes treatment plan. Initial
                        A1C test also helps to establish your baseline level. How often you need this test depends on
                        the type of diabetes, your treatment plan, how well you are meeting treatment goals and your
                        doctor's clinical judgment. The recommended protocol for this test is: Once every year if you
                        have prediabetes; Twice a year if you do not use insulin and your blood sugar level is
                        consistently within your target range; Four times a year if you take insulin or have trouble
                        keeping your blood sugar level within your target range.

                        infection, kidney stones, diabetes, liver & kidney problems. This test is routinely performed
                        prior to any surgery. Your doctor may order a urinalysis if you experience symptoms such as
                        blood in urine, back or abdominal pain, painful urination, frequent urination & cloudy urine.

                        from the food you eat and is carried by blood to all the cells to use for its various functions.
                        If sugar rises in your blood, you suffer from Diabetes which can be Type 1 or Type 2 or
                        Prediabetes. A reading of 126 mg/dL in a fasting state or greater than 200 mg/dL after 2 hours
                        of eating or glucose drink is considered diabetic. If your values are between 100 to 125 mg/dL,
                        you are considered to be prediabetic. You must test your blood glucose levels regularly if you
                        are above 35 years of age; body mass index is higher than 25; women with diabetes during
                        pregnancy; suffer from prediabetes. This test is useful to monitor the effect of diabetes
                        medications; identify blood sugar levels that are high or low; track your progress in reaching
                        your overall treatment goals; learn how diet and exercise affect blood sugar levels; understand
                        how other factors, such as illness or stress affect blood sugar levels.

                        problems. These are a group of tests which are helpful to screen for liver infections; determine
                        how well a treatment is working; measure the severity of a disease; monitor possible side
                        effects of medications. Kidney function tests (KFT) are usually ordered when a patient has risk

                        cardiovascular disease, obesity, elevated cholesterol or a family history of kidney disease. It

                        Dengue viruses and all of them can cause disease. Symptoms are like flu resulting in fever,
                        headache & muscle pain. Later on a rash may also appear. Severe infection can cause bleeding &
                        you may go into shock. Detection of NS1 antigen is associated with a higher risk of developing
                        severe illness specially if positive beyond 5th day of fever. This is a sensitive test for the
                        detection of NS1 antigen.
